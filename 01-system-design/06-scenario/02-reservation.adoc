A reservation platform enables users to book real-time services such as rides (like Uber) or accommodations (like Booking.com). It handles real-time availability, booking consistency, payment integration, and notifications. System design must balance performance, eventual consistency, and integration with third-party services while ensuring scalability and responsiveness.
