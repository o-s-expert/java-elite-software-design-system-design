A social media platform like Twitter (now X) enables users to post short messages ("tweets"), follow others, like and comment, and view a real-time feed. It must support high volumes of reads and writes, scale globally, deliver low-latency feeds, and ensure eventual consistency across services like notifications, analytics, and timelines. The design should balance personalization, fan-out strategies, and throughput optimization.
