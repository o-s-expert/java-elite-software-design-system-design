== ❌ Inheritance Gone Wrong

A cake has salt.
The sea has salt.
But a cake **is not** a sea. Yet some code tries to do this:

[source,java]
----
class Sea {
  boolean hasSalt() { return true; }
}

class Cake extends Sea {
  // 🤯 Makes no semantic sense
}
----

== ✅ Composition Done Right

Use `has-a` instead of `is-a`:

[source,java]
----
class Salt {}

class Sea {
  Salt salt = new Salt();
}

class Cake {
  Salt salt = new Salt();
}
----

== 🎨 Diagram

[source,mermaid]
----
classDiagram
  class Salt

  class Sea {
    +Salt salt
  }

  class Cake {
    +Salt salt
  }

  Sea --> Salt : has-a
  Cake --> Salt : has-a
----

== 💡 Key Takeaway

* Use inheritance only when `A is a B` is semantically correct.
* Use composition when `A has a B` or `A uses B`.
