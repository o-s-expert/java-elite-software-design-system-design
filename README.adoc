==== Tactical DDD
- Patterns
- Overview
- Entity
- Aggregator
- Repository

== System Design

=== Basic Principles of System Design
- System components: front-end, back-end, databases, caches
- Scalability: vertical vs horizontal
- Availability and consistency: CAP theorem and trade-offs
- Latency and throughput: how to optimize both

=== Databases
- SQL
- NoSQL
- NewSQL
- CAP / PACELC

=== Designing Scalable Systems
- Data partitioning (sharding)
- Load balancers
- Use of caches (Redis, Memcached) for optimization
- Distributed databases and replication

=== Communication Between Components
- Synchronous APIs (REST, gRPC)
- Asynchronous communication with queues and message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Robust interface design for integration

=== High Availability and Fault Tolerance
- Resilient projects with Circuit Breakers and retries
- Replication and failover strategies
- Tools for monitoring and automatic recovery (auto-healing)

=== Practical Case Studies
- Reservation system (like Uber or Booking)
- Social media feed (like Instagram or Twitter)
- High-scale e-commerce (like Amazon)
