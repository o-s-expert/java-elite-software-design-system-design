== 🎯 Goal

Use the C4 Model to design the **C1: System Context** diagram for a modern banking system.

== 📌 Requirements

Design a system that includes the following external actors:

* 👤 **Customer** – accesses the system through a mobile/web app.
* 🧑‍💼 **Bank Employee** – uses an internal portal to assist customers.
* 🏛️ **Central Bank System** – validates high-value transactions and regulatory compliance.
* 💳 **Payment Processor** – handles credit/debit card transactions.

== 📐 Instructions

* Define the **banking system** as the central box.
* Identify and label external systems or users.
* Use arrows to show **interactions** and **data flow** between them.
* Suggest tools like:
** C4-PlantUML
** Structurizr DSL
** [Mermaid with Kroki](https://kroki.io)

== 💬 Bonus Questions

* Where would you enforce authentication and authorization?
* Should customers and employees use the same interface?

🧠 _This is a C1-level view, so focus on people and systems — not internal components yet!_
