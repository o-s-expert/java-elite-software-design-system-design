== Context

We need to choose a database strategy for the user profile service.
The system requires flexible schema, horizontal scalability, and fast iterations.

== Decision

We will use *MongoDB* for its schema flexibility and scaling features.
Future read models can be optimized separately if needed.

== Consequences

* Fast initial development
* Potential complexity in ACID transactions
* We'll need to monitor data growth and indexing
