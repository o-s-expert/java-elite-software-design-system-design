== Why This Architecture?

* 🌐 The **Webhook Service** is responsible for **receiving external requests** and storing raw data safely.
* 🧳 A **message is published** so the internal **Payment System** can process asynchronously.
* 🧵 This decouples external events from internal systems, enabling:
- Retry logic
- Auditing of raw data
- Parallel or delayed processing

== 💡 Notes

* The Raw DB can be a PostgreSQL or NoSQL store.
* The message format may follow a schema (e.g., Avro, JSON Schema).
* Use dead-letter queues or retry strategies for resilience.
